Curve is my first VR game and was made using Unity. The game was inspired by a scene from Tron Legacy where the protaganist had to dual an opponent using a frisbee. In our game the players are placed in an arena and tasked to hit their opponent three times with the frisbee to win. I developed the frisbee mechanic of it using research from V.R. Morrison on the aerodynamics of a frisbee. <br/> You can find my code on <a href="https://github.com/Bumflr/CMGT-Project-Block-1-Year-2/tree/Senne's-Branch" target="_blank"> this repo. </a>
