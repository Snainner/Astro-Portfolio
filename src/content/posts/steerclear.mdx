Steer Clear has been developed to raise awareness of the dangers of distracted driving. It was made in Unreal Engine 4.27 to make it compatible with the open-source traffic simulator Carla. I was responsible for mechanics to distract the player and the UI. I integrated live internet radio and a notification system for the distraction aspect. The notification system uses Pushbullet from which I used their API and web socket to let Unreal Engine send notifications to a phone and added the ability to see if the player opened the notification. I also designed and implemented the UI for the game. Making use of List View to show the user-created messages for the notifications.
