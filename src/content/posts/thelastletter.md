We were tasked to develop a game in Unity to stimulate children to go outside more. We came up with the idea of a wolf in the forest that is a postman. The wolf is tasked to deliver letters but one of the letters doesn’t have an address on it. The player has to deliver the other letters and find out through the other animals it is delivering letters to where the last letter is supposed to go. During the playthrough, the player will collect parts of stamps with animals on them. With each stamp, the player finds he or she gets a new fact about the animal. When all four stamps of a certain animal get collected the player gets a little DIY project in the stamp book for him or her to make. I created a custom camera and movement system for it.
