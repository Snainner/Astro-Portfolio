The task was to create a game for a touchscreen table at the DSH office. The requirements of the game were that it needed some kind of high-score system and include facts about DSH. We ended up making a racing game with procedural track generation. The track is generated by spawning a bunch of points and calculating its convex hull of it. The points in the convex hull then get displaced to create extra curves for a racetrack. The user generating the track can choose the difficulty, how close the curves are together and the amount of displacement added to the points. The player can then compete against others for the best time. While driving the player sees the ghost of the current best time on the track.
