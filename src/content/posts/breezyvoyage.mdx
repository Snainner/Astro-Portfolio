The goal of this project was to create a relaxing game for children between the ages of 8 to 14 in medical settings. The client was VRelax and wanted the game to be playable without controllers. We came up with a procedural generated exploration game where the player explores the world in a hot air balloon. I was in charge of the procedural generation for which I created height map generator using perlin noise from which the mesh is created. 
It features a dynamic LoD system and it will automatically turn of terrain chunks outside of the players view.<br/> <br/>
My work can be find on my branch of the project <a href="https://github.com/Jorrinkie/Year2Block2/tree/SennesBranch">branch</a>
