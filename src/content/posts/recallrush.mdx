Recall Rush is a mobile game where the player has to memorize the level and swipe the same directions after. It starts out with two moves but becomes more complex quickly. I created this game in Unity and the visuals in the shader graph. I also made an itch.io page for it. https://spwander.itch.io/recall-rush
